# node-jut

This module is a handler for the [JUT REST API](http://jut.io).  This module is
very simple and was constructed for our ( [C2C Schools, LLC](http://www.c2cschools.com/) ) 
own internal use.  Thus, it should not be considered as ready for production deployment.  
Instead, it was published here in the hopes that someone else might find it useful.
